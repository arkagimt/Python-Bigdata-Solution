## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
•	What does high-level language (HLL) mean?
In computer programming, a high-level language (HLL) is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. Such languages are easier and more natural for people to use than machine code or assembly language, which require knowledge of details that are hidden from the user by the HLL. The difference between low-level and high-level programming languages is that Low-level languages are closer to machine code, which is the code that a computer executes directly. High-level languages are further from machine code and closer to natural languages like English.
In general, high-level languages are less efficient in terms of memory and processing power than low-level languages because the language has to provide an abstraction for the programmer. However, this trade-off is usually worth it because high-level languages make programming easier and more fun!
•	What makes python a high-level programming language?
In a general understanding of highest-to-lowest languages, Python tops the list: Python/PHP, Ruby and Perl, Google Go, Java/C/C++, Assembly
According to the basic principle of coding, the factor that makes a language high level is its distance from machine binary code. How many layers of code the language is away from the machine's simple 0s and 1s is what practically decides the level of any programming language. In the software engineering world, Python is understood as a high-level, interpreted general-purpose language. This means it is not your straight compiled language (like Java or C) but an interpreted dynamic language that has to be run in the given system using another program instead of its local processor. When compiled, other languages turn into Assembly and run directly in the processor. Hence, being an interpreted language, which is not subject to the processor, makes Python a high-level programming language.

Also, Python is a high-level programming language that is known for its ease of readability. Python’s syntax is designed to be easy to read and understand resulting in fewer coding steps for developers than imposed by Java or C++. This makes it a great choice for beginners who are just starting to learn programming. 
Python is also portable, meaning that it can run on any platform, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and even Raspberry Pi. In addition, Python supports development in AI which is a rapidly growing field, and Python is a language that is well-suited for development in this area.  With its high level of readability and portability, Python is an excellent choice for high-level programming.
•	Why do we call Python as a general-purpose programming language?
In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be used for building software in a wide variety of application domains, across a multitude of hardware configurations and operating systems. In theory, a GPL program can run equivalently on a single processor or on a network. The opposite of a general-purpose programming language is a domain-specific programming language, which is designed to be used within a specific area, for example, querying databases. For example, SQL was designed for querying databases.

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
